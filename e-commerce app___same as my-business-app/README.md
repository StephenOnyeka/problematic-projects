 I used <b>React.js</b> which contains all the
 necessary JSON files for creating A web
 application. 

I indulged the use of third-party packages such
 as <i>react-skeleton</i> for displaying skeletons of the
 navigated page, <i>Framer motion</i> for rendering logo
 image animations, <i>React-router-dom</i> for routing.
 

 In the <b>CSS</b> category of the desktop site, I
 learnt <i>parallax scrolling</i> for background images
 in few sections/ routes. The cart renders your
 added products by means of local storage as they
 wonâ€™t be cleared or deleted except when  the
 defined remove button is clicked. The increment
 and decrement button are also declared.
